[![Custom AV Player](https://github.com/pushpendra996/avplayer-swift-part-1-ios/blob/main/Custom%20AV%20Player%20in%20Swift%20iOS.png?raw=true)](https://youtu.be/naMfH2nryvQ)


Welcome to Part 2 of the Custom AV Player Series! In this part, we'll dive deeper into building a video player like Netflix, Prime, and Hotstar in iOS using Swift. In this specific video, we'll focus on implementing device rotation control to enhance the user experience and provide seamless video playback.

## Features Covered in Part 2

* **Detecting device rotation events:** We'll show you how to detect when the user rotates their device from portrait to landscape or vice versa.
* **Adjusting the player layout dynamically:** We'll guide you through dynamically adjusting the video player's layout to fit the new device orientation.
* **Handling video playback during rotation:** We'll ensure that the video playback continues smoothly during device rotation without any interruption.
